#Hi 
in order to save some precious bandwidth there we have mpv to the rescue... this doesnt require installation... you just have to do this:
Go to the c: \ mpv folder or create it ...
And paste the playlist with this style
Https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzL3lffmd-wPr9dP6YGHUzMTch0949a_8

The youtube-dl will index our playlist ... then there is a series of command line enter [NEXT button] the < is the [BACK button]

The command in question taken from https://mpv.io/manual/master/ as an example the playlist that we have above would be:

Mpv https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzL3lffmd-wPr9dP6YGHUzMTch0949a_8 --no-video --playlist-pos = 2

If we say with mpv.exe will open a window ...
this version is tested in windows 7 64 bits... ENJOY!!!
